Deep Reinforcement Learning with Tetris
=============


### Description

This project aims to create a game agent that learns Tetris through in-depth reinforcement learning.
Tetris is a typical Sparse Reward Environment. And it is one of the difficult problems in reinforcement learning.

We aim to create model-free AI through several techniques.
